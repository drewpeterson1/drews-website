            <h2>Create the Great</h2>
                <p>One of the most empowering powers humans possess is the abilty to create. Creativity is fundamental to human flourishing, ability to express, connect, enjoy. Life is art. The life you choose to live is art. Humans are constantly creating themselves. Creating their ideas. Expressing themselves through art, music, drawing, writing, comedy. Creativity is brining something that enlivens the world to fruition. It is paving a positive path forward to broad horizons. Often creative destruction is an element, in order to create, new, more genuine floruishing, need to destroy old ways. THe only constant in the world is change, being able to flow with that change and benefit from it. Wind puts out some flames, wind helps other flames spread. New ideas are often about the combination of multiple existing elements, combining them in new helpful ways. I believe in the children, listen to the kids bro. But children are not the only ones who can create. With more in depth experiences, able to create more richly and deeply.</p>

            <h2>T3CHN0</h2>
                <p>Technology is the driving force behind human advancement. It can be a cause for immense progress and improvement in human life. Technology can do amazing things and generate tremendous amount of value. It has been faascinating learning about technolgoical advancments. There is a lof of work to be done, aveneues to explore, value to bring, and money to be made through technology. Part of creating is having the skills to know how to create. Technology enables new things to be created, and mass distributed. Learned about Perkins Law (advances in technology less reliant on marketing), moment of shift with AI, drawn to learn more and desire to become active in shift, before AI it was AR, it was blogging had a blog & instagram page with 5,000+ followers. Published App from idea to product on App Store, hired people to create app, and am learning to empower my own creations. Especially with the power of Computer supported intelligence, there is immense power in knowing how technology works, and using it in productive ways.</p>

            <h2>Bring it Around Town</h2>
                <p>Interested in the intersection of economics of the environment. I don't know why exactly I felt drawn to be the steward of the world. Maybe it is the good-guy sentiment that I grew up with. Interesting challenge to keep standard of living high while preserving the single planet we have. Was in Bali working on an organic rice farm, saw this dude coming to make hotel cards by melting plastic trash he found on the street. Got me thinking about what to with empty trash, realizing most of the container is exactly the same after use, just without the liquid. Try to sell it back to the companies or reuse the containers. Landed on a stream of thought <a href= >seen here</a> (excuse the Dana from Silicon Valley voice) about getting emtpty containers back around again. Joined a new startup doing that and learned a lot. Interesting that investing in a reusable container is worse for the environment if used once because more resources go into producing it, but if used dozens of times each use is better for the environment because rather than producing new containers, you just have to clean and ship a new one. It is an elegantly simple model to take waste and make it material, but it doesn't full capture logistics considerations, consumer interest, or cost considerations. Anyways, it taught me about the importance of convenience & affordability, and the mass market consumers. Also interesting that recycling is a business if you can get more money from selling the end material than it costs to collect & process it, otherwise businesses are gulted into subsidizing the disposal. Anyway, the intentional design of products can enable reuse and the full circle of Cradle to Cradle is interesting.</p>

            <h2>Something Ventured</h2>
                <p>An astonishing amount of the most successful companies start off as a few people who don't really know much of what they're doing. They're working on something they want to create. They don't have much money to create a full company yet. They need outsdie funding to build a team to work on this project. That is where Venture Capital comes in. Venture Capitalists back buckets of young companies with investments for portions of the company's equity. Some of these companies grow and mature into incredibly successful enterprises. The success from the winners more than covers the majority of cases where the investments melts to zero. What is fascinating are two things: (1) how close to the cutting edge of creation of new comapnies these investments are (2) how exponential the returns on just one winner can be (Power Law). In terms of investments, the public market is figured out -- put all you can into a low-cost Vanguard index fund. Don't try to beat the market. Don't pay someone to return below the market. Find success by reaping the solid market share of the returns of top corporations. On the private investing side, there is more to consider and evaluate -- more potential to drive and facilitate real value through investing in provate companies. Venture is exciting because it is at the intersection of new technology and understanding how to reap returns from well-placed investments.</p>

            <h2>For Freedom</h2>
                <p>Steve Jobs, canâ€™t connect the dots looking forward, trust in looking back. Money is about freedom. Money is not an end in and of itself. Money is necessary to have the means to live a nourished life. Freedom of thought and mind, and being are the purpose. To live how you see fit, to buy what you want, to eat food, to live in a certain way. Aint never seen no U-Haul behind no herst. Freedom is the ultimate use.</p>
