                <p class="p-desc"> Growing up, I remember first playing basketball on a nerf hoop in my living room, shooting hoops in the driveway, and going to my older brothers' high school games. Basketball was the first thing I poured hours & hours of effort into. As a short-ish white kid from New York, I had to compensate for not always being the tallest or most athletic. I would spend hours in the basement at night doing dribbling drills, spend time going into school early to put shots up, and play in practice and games regularly. In high school, I rose from the end of the bench to starting point guard. Thanks to <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkdkwCnbYXw target="_blank">a little help from above</a> our team went to New York State finals. I was recruited to play college basektball at a 26,000 student university in Canada. Basketball taught me a lot of lessons, & it has been a way for me to connect with many different people and cultures. The game itself is fun to play & watching it with friends & family is a fun activity.</p>

        <h2 class="interest"> The Good Life</h2>
            <p class="p-desc">When I was entering college, I had questions about what was the best way to live. I had grown up catholic, and I figured if that whole thing was true, then I should probably live as is decreed. As I matured, I started realizing that factually, there may not be a tremendous indisputable conviction about the factual support of the decrees. As I have matured further, I relize there may be more than the literal truth of the accounts, but that certain stories themselves hold value that helps guide people. Nevertheless, if religion did not feel capable of providing an answer to how to live best, then I had to create that value for myself. Think of that -- I am given the gift of life on this planet arising out of nothing, and I courageously determine what meaning my life has. How am I to live? While I thought for some time, to make as little impact as possible does not seem like the mark of a life well lived. While I respect and appreciate meditation practice, there is more to life than sitting down, feeling calm, and doing nothing. Meditation is training in the art of living well. Should I try to calculate the end result of all actions to determine the one that will lead to the best outcome? Well, as I am on the borderline of being neurotic already, I realize that the end outcome is very difficult to determine looking forward. As Steve Jobs said, you can't connect the dots looking forward -- you can only connect the dots looking backward. Taking yourself too seriously (which I feel guilty of at times) comes from trying to control the outcome of circumstances you have little control over. Still, you do your best. Life is pretty simple, you make decisions and move forward. Most people are controlled by fear. If trying to control the outcome is ineffecitve and can lead to neurotic behavior, what should we do then? We can live in a certain alignment with values. It is not about the outcome, it is about the principles that guide you along the way. If you are religious, you are guided by the principles given by your dogma. In a way, that's kind of nice -- you don't have to make decisions based on your own reasoning, and can defer to what you believe in. In other ways, if you don't genuinely feel compelled to devote your strucutre of being around religion, then it would be inauthentic to do so. Without a believable religious strucutre that you can genuinely devote your life to, then you are in a precarious but exciting positon to determine the set of values to live your life by and orient around. Without a genuinely believable divine force, people are left to determine meaning in their own lives. Nietsche's "God is Dead" quote is not a celebratory remark. It is meant to describe Christianity as no longer a potent culutral force. He sees that the world has lost a central guiding ideal as not a positive thing, and that people will have to create meaning in their own lives. The task becomes creating meaning for your life, and courageously following the principles that you posit. This is where authenticity comes in. Aesthetic is the way we discover and create our own individuality.</p>

        <h2 class="interest">You're Grounded</h2>
            <p class="p-desc"> There is a lot of noise in today's world. Trying to keep up with others expectations makes one feel not good enough. With outside influences, not all of them are in your best intentions to follow. Constant messages, always feeling behind, catching up with X Y and Z. It can be easy to lose count of what you are feeling inside. Of checking in with yourself. Sending myself love. Empowering the voice inside. Affirming myself, that I am good enough. I am the most important. Mindfullness is a tool that I have grown to enjoy. It helps re-center, slow down, come from a place of groundedness. While there is much more to life than just sitting down & doing nothing, taking space away is beneficial to engage more fully. So that you're taken away by an emotion. So that you're able to listen to your inner self. There is a balance between immersion and enjoying flow. If you are enjoying a positive immersion, ride the flow! If there is a neutral moment or want to reset, then taking time with deep breaths is helpful. Inhale through the nose. Pause. Exhale through the mouth for twice as long as the inhale. The mind will jump -- compassionately bringing atten back to breath. Rousseau, morality is following the voice of reason within us. Recovering authentic moral contact with oneself, is a source of joy and freedom. Freedom from external influences, from external pressure, from deviation from oneself. Bring attention back to your authenticity. Meditation is not the point of life. Meditiation is training in the art of living well. </p>

        <h2 class="interest">Gustin</h2>
            <p class="p-desc">I grew up sailing during the summers. From being a scared kid in a floating bathtub, to actually learning how to sail proficiently it was a part of my childhood. I was never too into the theory and racing behind it, but it was an enjoyable experience to be out on the water, floating around. As I grew up, I spent more of my summers playing basketball over doubling down into sailing. As some of my friends got into good sailing squads in college, they became involved in other types of windsports. For example, I have friends who went to school to go sailing, and then left the school with a new skill in kiteboarding. During the pandemic, a friend taught me the basics of how to windsurf. It took a lot of practice, a lot of falling into the water, and a lot of pulling up the sail out of the water, but I became pretty decent. The first day I bought some used gear of my own for a few hundred bucks, I went out on the water, enjoyed my new toy, & soaked uo the sunset. The only problem was that when the sun went down, the wind died! I was stuck in the middle of a bay with no wind, no lights, and no chance of getting back to shore before it got dark. In a clear harbor, one boat was flying by a mile away. They were just about to pass me, when at the last minute they took a 90 degree turn and saved me -- thank God for the Coast Guard! I have since learned tricks about when to go. Generally, if I'm not getting tossed in the water, then it's not windy & challenging enough. I also picked up kiteboarding, taking a few lessons in FL & OR. I think I enjoy windpsorts because it connects me with a skill I learned growing up, it enables me to enjoy an activity with friends, and it's pretty fun out on the water. It's living proof that I can learn & grow at anything I practice.</p>

        <h2 class="interest"> Tea Plea</h2>
            <p class="p-desc">In a quest to live & experience life as it is, without the inflence of external factors or drugs, I have avoided caffeine intensive substances for some time. I have not been interested in becoming addicted to drugs. That sounds obvious, but I want to live a life that has value and is energizing without needing a drug or external stimulus to feel alive. It's part of my quest to live authentically. I especially did not want my life to be dependent on having a 5 cups of coffee to get me through the day or have a redbull to feel energized. Yet, at the same time, I did acknowledge that having some form of a pick-me-up on occasion may promote a floruishing, energetic life. The answer I found is somewhat surprising</p>
