<h1>Value be True</h1>
<p>You can live by values put onto you. You can also live by descerning what is valauble to you. Discerning values is a practice that involves awareness, thought, and most importantly, human experience. Here are some values that I hold to guide my direction:</p>

<div class="values"> 

    <div class="value" id="playfulness"> 
        <h2>Playfulness</h2> <p>In the serious business of setting values, playfulness is often overlooked. Have fun in the most serious situations. Cheerfulness, affirming life. Breaking expected rules of adults,  for real fun.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="value" id="courage">
        <h2>Courage</h2>
        <p>The father of all virtues, courage is doing something based on a belief you have, even if it feels scary. The win is doing the thing that scares you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="value" id="growth">
        <h2>Growth</h2>
        <p>Learning and growing through life. I am a fluid being who is always improving from every experience. I can learn and grow. AntiFRAGILE</p>
    </div>

    <div class="value" id="confidence">
        <h2>Confidence</h2>
        <p>Uncle Ed taught me something important: you do not have to have it all figured out to be confident -- all you need is to trust that you'll excell in any situation or goal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="value" id="respect">
        <h2>Respect</h2>
        <p>In setting authentic values, it can be easy to discount others. It's my life, I can do whatever I want, its all about me. As Taylor described, this adolescent view of authenticity does not account for authenticity is defiend in conversation with others. Moating yourself off from others narrows your view of what you can ascribe meaning to in your own life. Connection with others part of what is requried for deep fun. Orma, other people are huge potential values to us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="value" id="strength">
        <h2>Strength</h2>
        <p>Strength is along the lines of courage. But stength is when you don't know exactly how to proceed. Strength means not being afraid to hold uncertain ground while searching for a solution. Strength is being strong enough to do the things that will take time and energy and resilience to accomplish. To know discipline is freedom</p>
    </div>

    <div class="value" id="change-propel">
        <h2>Change Propeller</h2>
        <p>Change is the only constant. It can be scary. The small, enclosed mind wants things to stay the same. As Einstein said, life is like riding a bicycle, in order to stay balance you have to keep moving forward. Use change as a way to propel forward. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="value" id="trust">
        <h2>Trust</h2>
        <p>Trust, in what I don't know exactly. It is not naieve. Tempting to try to figure everything out and calculate consequences of every move, but I have learned it is proven not easy to understand how things will unfold and has led to stress trying to figure out things and change beyond scope of not being omnipotent, or knowing all the information up front, or how things will unfold.  William James value of belief is practical benefit for human beings. Steve Jobs, trust in the universe, god, yourself, whatever, need to trust that it will work out ok. Pretty scary at the time, decided to trust it will all work out OK.</p>
